# Project Planning with Beads

## Agent Instructions

You are an expert software architect creating a comprehensive task breakdown. This task graph will be executed by AI agents working in parallel, coordinated through MCP Agent Mail with file reservations to prevent conflicts.

<quality_expectations>
Create a thorough, production-ready task graph. Include all necessary setup, implementation, testing, and documentation tasks. Go beyond the basics - consider edge cases, error handling, security considerations, and integration points. Each task should be specific enough for an agent to execute independently without ambiguity.

## Your Task

Analyze this project and create a comprehensive **Beads task graph** using the `bd` CLI. Beads provides dependency-aware, conflict-free task management for multi-agent execution.

---

## Output Format

Generate a shell script that creates the full task graph. The script should:

1. **Initialize Beads** (if not already initialized)
2. **Create all beads** with appropriate priorities
3. **Establish dependencies** between beads
4. **Add labels** for phase grouping

### Example Output

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Project: {PROJECT_NAME}
# Generated: {DATE}

set -e

# Initialize beads if needed
if [ ! -d ".beads" ]; then
    bd init
fi

echo "Creating project beads..."

# ========================================
# Phase 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure
# ========================================

bd create "Initialize project with Vite + React + TypeScript" -p 0 --label setup
SETUP_VITE=$(bd list --json | jq -r '.[-1].id')

bd create "Configure ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript strict mode" -p 1 --label setup
SETUP_LINT=$(bd list --json | jq -r '.[-1].id')
bd dep add $SETUP_LINT $SETUP_VITE

bd create "Set up Tailwind CSS with design system tokens" -p 1 --label setup
SETUP_TAILWIND=$(bd list --json | jq -r '.[-1].id')
bd dep add $SETUP_TAILWIND $SETUP_VITE

bd create "Configure testing framework (Vitest + Testing Library)" -p 1 --label setup
SETUP_TESTING=$(bd list --json | jq -r '.[-1].id')
bd dep add $SETUP_TESTING $SETUP_LINT

# ========================================
# Phase 2: Core Architecture
# ========================================

bd create "Implement API client with error handling and retries" -p 0 --label core
API_CLIENT=$(bd list --json | jq -r '.[-1].id')
bd dep add $API_CLIENT $SETUP_VITE

bd create "Set up global state management (Zustand/Jotai)" -p 0 --label core
STATE_MGMT=$(bd list --json | jq -r '.[-1].id')
bd dep add $STATE_MGMT $SETUP_VITE

bd create "Create authentication context and hooks" -p 0 --label core
AUTH_CONTEXT=$(bd list --json | jq -r '.[-1].id')
bd dep add $AUTH_CONTEXT $STATE_MGMT
bd dep add $AUTH_CONTEXT $API_CLIENT

# ... continue for all phases ...

echo ""
echo "Bead graph created! View with:"
echo "  bv                    # Interactive TUI"
echo "  bv --robot-triage     # AI-friendly recommendations"
echo "  bd ready              # List unblocked tasks"
```

## Bead Creation Guidelines

### Priority Levels
- `-p 0` = Critical (blocking other work)
- `-p 1` = High (important but not blocking)
- `-p 2` = Medium (standard work)
- `-p 3` = Low (nice to have)

### Labels (Phase Grouping)
Use `--label` to group beads by phase:
- `setup` - Project initialization
- `core` - Core architecture
- `auth` - Authentication/authorization
- `ui` - UI components
- `feature-{name}` - Feature-specific work
- `testing` - Test coverage
- `docs` - Documentation
- `deploy` - Deployment/CI

### Dependency Rules
1. Never create cycles
2. Every bead should have a clear dependency chain back to setup tasks
3. Use `bd dep add CHILD PARENT` (child depends on parent completing first)
4. Parallel work should share a common ancestor, not depend on each other

### Task Granularity
- Each bead should be completable in **under 750 lines of code**
- Tasks should be atomic enough for one agent to complete without coordination
- If a task requires multiple file areas, consider splitting by file area

---

## File Reservation Planning

For each major work area, note the file patterns that will need exclusive reservation:

```bash
# Example reservation notes (add as bead descriptions)
# Auth work: src/auth/**, tests/auth/**, src/hooks/useAuth*
# API client: src/api/**, src/lib/fetch*, tests/api/**
# UI components: src/components/{ComponentName}/**, tests/components/{ComponentName}/**
```

This helps agents claim appropriate file surfaces when they start work.

---

## Agent Mail Thread Convention

When beads are created, threads will be automatically created with pattern `bd-{id}`:

| Thread Pattern | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| `bd-{id}` | Main work discussion |
| `bd-{id}-review` | Code review |
| `bd-{id}-blocked` | Blocker escalation |

---

## Context Documentation

Place any important context in `proompts/docs/` for agents to reference. This includes:
- Architecture decisions
- API documentation
- Design system specs
- External service integration guides

---

## Verification Steps

After generating the script:

1. **Run it**: `chmod +x setup-beads.sh && ./setup-beads.sh`
2. **Verify graph**: `bv --robot-insights` to check for cycles
3. **Check ready work**: `bd ready` should show initial setup tasks
4. **Review plan**: `bv --robot-plan` to see parallel tracks

---

## Completeness Checklist

Ensure your task graph includes:

- [ ] All setup and configuration tasks
- [ ] Core architecture and shared utilities
- [ ] Feature implementation tasks (broken into small units)
- [ ] Error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Unit and integration tests for each feature
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Security considerations (input validation, auth checks)
- [ ] Performance considerations where relevant
- [ ] CI/CD and deployment tasks
- [ ] Clear dependency chains with no cycles
